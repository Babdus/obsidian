#definition 
[[word-form|Word-forms]] in an [[inflection|inflectional]] [[paradigm]] generally share (at least) one
longer [[morpheme]] with a concrete [[meaning]] and are distinguished from
each other in that they in addition contain different shorter [[morpheme|morphemes]]
with an abstract [[meaning]]. Such short [[morpheme|morphemes]] with an abstract [[meaning]]
are called affixes.
