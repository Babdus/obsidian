The current vowels in the Celabric are:

| |Front|Near-front|Near-back|Back|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Close||y̠|||
|Near-close|ɪ̟||ʊ̜|o̝|
|Mid|ø̞||||
|Near-open|æ|||ɑ̝|

The vowel that bugs me is /ʊ/.

When I try to pronounce words at a natural pace all other vowels feel pretty stable and in harmony with each other, but whenever I encounter the /ʊ/ the whole articulation crumbles.

To be fair, this vowel is the hardest for me to pronounce in English as well and maybe it's only my case and in overall these vowels seem stable to you.

I see that /ɪ/ and /o/ as well as /æ/ and /ɑ/ create quite a nice opposition and that is the reason for their stability. But I don't see how /ø/ and /y/ contribute to a natural paradigm, though in speech they fit perfectly. The only one that is left out is /ʊ/. Can you please help me to either pinpoint the problem or advise me on how to change the pronunciation? The complete dropping of this phoneme, unfortunately, is not a solution since it plays a significant role in morphology being in opposition with the other 6 vowels.

The history behind this phonology is quite simple: the first version of Celabric had much simpler arrangement:

| |Front|Central|Back|
|---|---|---|---|
|Close|i y||u|
|Mid|e̞ ø̞||o̞|
|Open||ä||

But it was missing an edge and after some time playing around with the intonational patterns and making the language more melodic, I discovered that I was semi-subconsciously shifting the 5 vowels /i e a o u/ counterclockwise on the vowel triangle halfway to the next vowel: /i/ became something between /i/ and /e/; /e/ became something between /e/ and /ä/ and so on. Then /y/ became slightly unrounded and shifted slightly back not to overlap with /ɪ/ and with the analogy I thought that /u/ could shift slightly forward and lose its roundness as well, but, to my horror, I can't stabilize it.
