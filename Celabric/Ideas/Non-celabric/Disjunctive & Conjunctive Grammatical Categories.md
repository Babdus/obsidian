I'm exploring the idea of **disjunctive plurality**—where a plural set isn't interpreted as "X and Y" but as "X or Y." This led me to generalize the concept beyond number and apply it to any grammatical category, including tense, aspect, mood, voice, degree, case, etc.

#### Disjunctive & Conjunctive Plural Pronouns

I know that there is a term **Disjunctive pronoun**, but I am not referring to it at all; I am thinking of **true disjunctive plural**, where elements are joined with _OR_ logical operator and not _AND_.

In my system, if:

- **mi** = _"I"_
- **ti** = _"you"_
- `CONJ(1SG,2SG)` → **pi** = _"you and me"_
- `DISJ(1SG,2SG)` → **ni** = _"either you or me"_

This transformation follows a **phonological mutation rule** based on a **grammatical priority hierarchy** (where `1SG` > `2SG`). When merging two morphemes:

- **Conjunctive (AND)**: The **preceding category** in priority retains **place of articulation** → _m AND t = p_
- **Disjunctive (OR)**: The **lesser-priority category** retains **place of articulation** → _m OR t = n_

This means that different grammatical categories can be fused through **predictable phonological shifts** based on priority. Therefore, for this system to work, every grammatical category should have defined hierarchical relationships.

Of course I could have just defined the **affix** for CONJ or DISJ and place them before (or after) the **mi** + **ti**, but isn't mutation much more fun, and to some extent, naturalistic?

#### **Generalizing to Other Grammatical Categories**

This system doesn't have to be limited to pronouns. It can apply to **tense**, for example, allowing us to express:

- _"Do you wear wigs AND will you wear wigs?"_ → `2SG wear-CONJ(PRES,FUT) wig-PL?`
- _"Do you wear wigs OR will you wear wigs?"_ → `2SG wear-DISJ(PRES,FUT) wig-PL?`

If we assume:

- Present = **-ta**
- Future = **-be**

and in category hierarchy `PRES` > `FUT`, then:

- `CONJ(PRES,FUT)` → **-də** (**ta** _AND_ **be**: {alveolar, voiceless, stop} _AND_ {bilabial, voiced, stop} → {alveolar, voiced, stop}; the same logic applies to the vowel: backness is from **a** and height is from **e**)
- `DISJ(PRES,FUT)` → **-pæ** (**ta** _OR_ **be** → {alveolar, voiceless, stop} _OR_ {bilabial, voiced, stop} → {bilabial, voiceless, stop})

This approach forces me to carefully structure my **phoneme inventory** so that any pair of grammatical morphemes can always merge into something valid. The main limitation is that **recursive CONJ/DISJ use is difficult**, but I’m still thinking of ways to allow it.

Would love to hear thoughts from you! is **grammatical disjunction/conjunction** something you would use?
