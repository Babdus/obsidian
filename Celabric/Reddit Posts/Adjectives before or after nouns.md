In Celabric, both before and after placements are permissible. However, if the adjective comes after the noun, it takes the case markers of that noun. Otherwise, it is not marked:

#### Before nouns:

**[[xjar]] [[cher]] [[ja]] [[kolfnakhish]] [[neflifraphr]] [[fla]] [[kyrkhish]] [[chrertrli]]**

_I see a broken blade with frozen eyes_

```
xjar       cher    ja  kolfnakhish neflifraphr fla kyrkhish chrertrli
1SG.(NOM)  see.PRS ACC broken      blade       PL  frozen   eye.INS
```

#### After nouns:

**[[xjar]] [[cher]] [[ja]] [[neflifraphr]] [[ja]] [[kolfnakhish]] [[fla]] [[chrertrli]] [[kyrkhishli]]**

_I see a blade broken with the eyes frozen_

```
xjar       cher    ja  neflifraphr ja  kolfnakhish fla chrertrli kyrkhishli
1SG.(NOM)  see.PRS ACC blade       ACC broken      PL  eye.INS   frozen.INS
```

The interesting thing happens when the genitive noun (or pronoun) is used postpositionally as a determiner: It also takes the case marker of the noun that it determines, therefore it will have two case markers, one for genitive and one for the other noun:

**[[xjyl]] [[xjary]] [[liaxjarn]] [[nefra]]**

_My king lives_

```
xjyl xjary   lizxjarn nefra
NOM  1SG.GEN king     be.INTS.PRS
```

But:

**[[xjyl]] [[liaxjarn]] [[xjyl]] [[xjary]] [[nefra]]**

_The king of mine lives_

```
xjyl liaxjarn xjyl xjary   nefra
NOM  king     NOM  1SG.GEN be.INTS.PRS
```

More and more bizarre, but beautiful it becomes if you stack multiple genitives:

**[[gjersht]] [[ja]] [[pylfnytn]] [[ja]] [[liaxjarny]] [[ja]] [[xjaryy]]**

_I remember the lullaby of the king of mine_

```
          gjersht           ja  pylfnytn ja  liaxjarn ja  xjaryy
(1SG.NOM) remember.INFR.PRS ACC lullaby  ACC king.GEN ACC 1SG.GEN.GEN
```

The difference in meaning between pre- and postpositional alignment is very sublime, only the focus is more or less shifted toward the adjectives (determiners) if they are after the nouns. Although both alignments are frequently used mainly in poetic or translational (or poetic translational) settings.
