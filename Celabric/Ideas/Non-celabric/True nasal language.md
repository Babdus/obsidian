#### Xhapfhi: A True nasal language

What if there was a language consisting only with true nasal sounds:
the sounds that are produced with an airflow **ONLY** through nose?

This is a true nasal fricative - **m͋**: a sound made when you have
closed mouth and air comes from the nose.

**Xhapfhi** has lot more than **m͋**

#### A little bit of context

There once was a prince, who had a severe case of ulcer. He smelled so bad
that the king and the queen after trying everything just sew his lips shut.
They fed him through something like modern nasogastric tube.

Because he was royalty and because this operation made him anorexic,
the sewing of lips became fashionable.

After only few generations their language had no other chance but to become
fully nasal.

Now the lip sewing is considered barbaric, but the language has been still
preserved as a truly nasal one.

| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| plosives   | voiced              | **b** /b͋/      | **g** /ɢ͋/      |
|            | voiceless aspirated | **ph** /p͋ʰ/    | **kh** /q͋ʰ/    |
|            | ejective            | **p** /p͋ʼ/     | **k** /q͋ʼ/     |
| fricatives | voiced              | **v** /β͋/      | **gh** /ʁ͋/     |
|            | voiceless aspirated | **fh** /ɸ͋ʰ/    | **xh** /χ͋ʰ/    |
|            | ejective            | **f** /ɸ͋ʼ/     | **x** /χ͋ʼ/     |

|            | voiceless aspirated | **pfh** /p͋ɸ͋ʰ/ | **kxh** /q͋χ͋ʰ/ |
|            | ejective            | **pf** /p͋ɸ͋ʼ/  | **kx** /q͋χ͋ʼ/  |
| trills     | voiced              |                 | **r** /ʀ͋/      |
|            | voiceless aspirated |                 | **rh** /ʀ̥͋ʰ/   |
- Naral sounds are made with nostrils
- Nasopharyngeals - with velum and uvula raised into nasopharynx
- Plosives are made by closing and releasing either nostrils or
  nasopharynx completely
- Fricatives are made restricting them
- Affricates are Plosives with fricative release
- Trills can be made by vibrating uvula

#### Vowels

|        | front        | central      | back         |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| closed | **i** /m͋ⁱ˥/ |              | **u** /m͋ᵘ˩/ |
| mid    | **e** /m͋ᵉ˦/ |              | **o** /m͋ᵒ˨/ |
| open   |              | **a** /m͋ᵃ˧/ |              |
All five vowels are just a true nasal fricative **m͋** but with tongue placed
in those positions as if you were trying to say real /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/ or /u/.
Although mouth is shut, the tongue makes different types of cavities
that serves like an equalizer.

Because these vowels sound very similar, Xhapfhi underwent something
similar to what has happened in Silbo Gomero - the vowels took tones
corresponding to the second formant Hz values of the real vowels they
represent: /m͋ⁱ˥/ the highest and /m͋ᵘ˩/ the lowest.



Good luck pronouncing! or as Xhapfhians say:

**Fhi eixh rhegghui avafi!**
