I am creating a future variety of Celabric language, approximately 500-1000 years after the current version. The first change I made is a phonological one and I would appreciate your feedback: how natural do you think the change and the result is? or anything else that you would like to point out.

Because the majority of modern Celabric words are derived using the theme suffixes **[[fla]]** /flɑ/, **[[fli]]** /flɪ/, **[[fra]]** /frɑ/, **[[fri]]** /frɪ/, **[[fna]]** /fnɑ/ and **[[fny]]** /fny/, the excess number of /f/-s ate gradually reduced to /h/: /f/ -> /ɸ/ -> /ʍ/ -> /h/. But this happens only before the sonorants (m, n, r, l), in other cases the /f/ is retained.

The second change is almost complete loosing of palatals: The palatal stops /c/, /ɟ/ and /cʰ/ are converted into /kj/, /ɡj/ and /kʰj/ before the vowels and into /ki/, /gi/ and /kʰi/ before sonorants. There no other cases because of the phonotactics of Celabric.

The /ç/ is then changed into /h/ and /ʝ/ is reduced to /j/.

As the palatal stops add a vowel after them before the sonorants so do the other stops, but in their case it is /ɨ/ and it only happens in the coda of the last syllable. It is already happening in the modern Celabric that the stops after the nasals of the same place of articulation are realized as glottal stops and, thus, they will remain as glottal stops after the insertion of the vowel: /tn/ -> /ʔn/ -> /ʔɨn/ or /bm/ -> /ʔ̬ɨm/.

The next step is that the generated /h/ will devoice and aspirate the sonorants before it: /rh/ -> /r̥ʰ/, /lh/ -> /ɬʰ/, /nh/ -> /n̥ʰ/, /mh/ -> /m̥ʰ/. And it will lengthen the vowels before it, for example: /oh/ -> /oː/. In the other positions it will remain as /h/.

When after this process the voiceless aspirated sonorants will appear before the respective voiced sonorants, this cluster will turn into germinated voiceless aspirated ones: /r̥ʰr/ -> /r̥ʰː/.

The /h/ after sonorants will disappear and force the sonorants to become germinated.

The vowels are continuing to rotate counterclockwise on the vowel triangle that is already halfway happened in the modern Celabric: /æ/ -> /ä/, /ɑ/ -> /ɔ/, /o/ -> /u/, /ʊ/ -> /ɨ/, /ɪ/ -> /e/. The /y/ and /ø/ will remain practically the same.

Currently the adjacent vowels create separate syllables, but in the future Celabric they will merge into diphthongs. Any vowel + /e/ will change into vowel + /ɪ/ diphthongs and any vowel + /u/ will change into vowel + /ʊ/, except /uu/ which will turn into long /uː/. This will give 13 diphthongs.

The vowel /ä/ in the last position will reduce to /ɐ/ and the /e/ into /ɘ/.

All these processes will transform 28 consonants and 7 vowels into 40 consonants, 10 simple vowels, 13 diphthongs and 7 long vowels.

Here are couple of examples with the both pronunciation:

**[[lioshchrertr]]** modern: /lɪoʃcʰrærtr/ future: /leʊ̯ʃkirärʔɨr/

**[[trerfratr]]** modern: /trærfrɑtr/ future: /trär̥ʰːɔʔɨr/

## Edits

y -> i
ji -> iː
ø -> ɛʊ
l -> ɫ
almost all CC -> CɨC, only these are left unchanged:
1. sonorant + consonant
2. consonant + rhotic, but not in coda
3. coronal fricative or affricate consonant + dorsal consonant with the same airflow
