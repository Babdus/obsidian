# 1. Introduction

Celabric is a constructed language that I have been working on since the year 2000. At first, as a fun way to polish up my invented country and its characteristics, it then advanced to an independent passion of mine; A two-page vocabulary grew into a full book filled with lots of grammar, pronunciation, and terrifyingly complicated script.

Although on the way I not once had to completely scratch out the whole grammar, vocabulary, or even phonology, the one thing that persevered was the tendency of the language to have a minimal set of words (in this case stems) that a learner has to memorize in order to be able to understand any text or be able to form any sentence consistently. Consequently, the complicated part fell onto grammar, and albeit not being simple, it nonetheless is well-structured. Even though the clear direction was an optimization, I didn't abandon the humanly natural and aesthetically pleasing aspects of the language. Hence, the result is some kind of chimera seeing themself as a phoenix.
