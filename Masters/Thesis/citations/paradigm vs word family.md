Complex [[lexeme|lexemes]] (such as READER or LOGICIAN) generally denote new concepts that are different from the concepts of the corresponding simple [[lexeme|lexemes]], whereas [[word-form|word-forms]] often exist primarily to satisfy a formal requirement of the [[syntax|syntactic]] machinery of the [[language]].

Complex [[lexeme|lexemes]] must be listed separately in dictionaries because they are less predictable than [[word-form|word-forms]].

By contrast, the properties of [[word-form|word-forms]] are mostly predictable and hence do not need to be listed separately for each [[lexeme]].
